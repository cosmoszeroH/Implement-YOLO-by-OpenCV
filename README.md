# Implement-YOLO-by-OpenCV

This repo contains knowledge I have about YOLO, you can find it in .pdf file

Additionally, I have implemented OpenCV's YOLO. The steps to implement are shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hank-ai/darknet.git

pip install opencv-python

pip install numpy

pip install wget
```

The image_run.py implements detection in an image, the video_run.py implements detection in camera.
